    If we have two or more distributions describing individual motions, which
    together make up the total motion, then it is the correlation functions 
    that are multiplied together, NOT the distributions themselves. Then, we 
    need to perform a special operation to get the distribution of correlation
    times resulting from a product of motions. This may be done by calculating
    the effective correlation time resulting from every possible pair of
    correlation times of two distributions. The result may be re-binned into
    a new distribution.
