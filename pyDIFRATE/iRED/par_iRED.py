    We create this class to perform parallel calculation of correlation functions.
    The variables required for calculation are stored as *class* variables, which
    are dictionaries. Because they are class variables, these are available to
    any instance of par_class (that is, if multiple par_class *objects* are 
    created by different processes, they will all have access to these dicts. To
    make problems unlikely, we assign the dictionary keys using a random number.
    That number is passed out to the parent process, and then used to find
    the correct data later. In principle, although different processes are 
    looking into the same dictionaries, they should avoid using/editing the same
    data)
