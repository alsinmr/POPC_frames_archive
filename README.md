# POPC_frames_archive
This archive provides the various python scripts required to perform the analyses shown in the paper "Characterizing the dynamic landscape of a bio-membrane with experiment and simulation", by A.A. Smith, A. Vogel, O. Enberg, P. Hildebrand, D. Huster

The main script is POPC_full_ana.py, which will execute in sequence the analysis of NMR experimental data, followed by analysis of MD simulated data for comparison, including plotting (exp_v_sim.py).
